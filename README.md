# *UA Capstone Project Team-4*

## **EEG Playback Tool**

### **Project Goals**
- Can record, store, and playback EEG data in a loop for analysis
- Can share EEG data with other users / publicly
- Includes an analysis/metrics tool (TBD)

### **Project Approach / Technologies / API**
 - Electron
 - Javascript 
 - React
 - Node.js
 - EEG Javascript Library (TBD)
 - Neurocity APIs and SDK (TBD)
 - Firebase

### **Project Use Case**
> A user will log into our app. Once logged in, a user can select a dataset from their already saved data. Once the dataset is loaded into our app, a user can play back the data on a loop and pause the play back for inspection. A user can also choose to look at a list of all of their saved data sets and share certain ones with other users or make them publicly available. Eventually, a user can also use an analysis tool to assist them in evaluating metrics.
